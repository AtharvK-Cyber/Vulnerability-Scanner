# Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

The **Vulnerability Scanner** is a Python-based network security tool designed to identify potential vulnerabilities in a given IP address or domain. This tool performs comprehensive port scanning, service detection, version enumeration, and vulnerability assessment, generating a detailed HTML report summarizing the findings. It is suitable for security professionals, system administrators, and anyone interested in network security assessments.

## Features

- **Port Scanning**: Identifies open ports and their statuses (open/closed/timed out) for a range of common ports.
- **Service Detection**: Determines the services running on open ports and their versions by analyzing service banners.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Cross-references detected services and versions with known vulnerabilities to identify potential security risks.
- **HTTP Analysis**: Extracts HTTP headers and analyzes allowed HTTP methods for web services.
- **SSL/TLS Certificate Analysis**: Reviews SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS services, if applicable.
- **Professional HTML Report**: Generates a well-formatted HTML report that includes open ports, services, versions, vulnerabilities, and additional HTTP and SSL/TLS information.
